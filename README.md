# acato

This is a repository for acato's front-end development challenge which contains a simple to-do list.

There are two components: 'Header' and 'To-do submitform' which are combined in one Story named 'To-do list'.

To-do list is the full standalone App.

The assignment took me about a total of 8 to 12 hours.

## **Setting up the project:**

###In Terminal:

> git clone git@github.com:muhammedabdelrehim/acato-frontend-challenge.git

> yarn cache clean && yarn install

> run yarn storybook
